Vulkan AstroSystem or simply Vulkan is a free open-source PHP component dealing with astrology.
Itâ€™s used for astrological data analysis and displaying astrological charts as well.

At present, there is the very first, beta version of the component. 
It provides the basic astrologic means for analysis and display of astrological charts. 
Much more useful features are to be added in the future.

The Vulkan AstroSystem objects are built for easy and flexible change of any elements of the component.

Vulkan Astrosystem uses Swetest of DestinyLab (https://github.com/DestinyLab/swetest) to calculate ephemeris data 
(which is based on Swiss Ephemeris). 
You can attach any other ephemeris calculations.

Requirements: PHP 5.6 or later.
